# Optimal-Relative-Transport
Some code to Get the Optimal relative Transport started. This will be slowly updated if needed.
We are merging two concepts to find the Total cost of Finding the cost of moving any two distributions together. 



To run a Julia project and download the project dependencies using the `Project.toml` and `Manifest.toml` files, you can follow these steps:

1. Download the project files, including the `Project.toml` and `Manifest.toml` files, or obtain them from the project repository.

2. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory where the `Project.toml` and `Manifest.toml` files are located.

3. Start the Julia REPL by typing `julia` in the terminal.

4. Enter the package manager mode by typing `]`. You should see a prompt like `(v1.x) pkg>`, indicating that you are in the package manager.

5. Activate the project environment by running the command `activate .`. The dot `.` represents the current directory.

6. Install the project dependencies by running the command `instantiate`. Julia will read the `Project.toml` and `Manifest.toml` files and install the required packages and their specific versions.

7. Once the installation is complete, exit the package manager by pressing the `backspace` key or by typing `exit`.

Now, the project dependencies should be successfully installed, and you can run the project code.

Note: It's important to ensure that you have Julia installed on your system before following these steps. You can download Julia from the official Julia website (https://julialang.org/downloads/) and install it according to the instructions for your operating system.

If you're sharing the project with others, provide them with the project files (including the `Project.toml` and `Manifest.toml` files) and guide them through the steps outlined above. This way, they can easily set up and reproduce the project's environment on their own systems.
